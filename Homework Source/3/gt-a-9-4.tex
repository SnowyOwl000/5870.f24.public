\item\problemnumber{GT A}{9}{4}{-}{.}
Suppose University High School (UHS) is electing its student-body president.
Suppose further that everyone at UHS is a candidate and voters write down the
student number of the person they are voting for, rather than checking a box.
Let $A$ be an array containing $n$ such votes, that is, student numbers for
candidates receiving votes, listed in no particular order. Your job is to
determine if one of the candidates got a majority of the votes, that is, more
than $n/2$ votes. Describe an $O(n)$-time algorithm for determining if there is
a student number that appears more than $n/2$ times in $A$.\\[12pt]
