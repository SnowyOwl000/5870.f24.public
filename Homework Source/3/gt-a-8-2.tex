Suppose we are given an $n$-element sequence $S$ such that each element in $S$
represents a different vote in an election, where each vote is given as an
integer representing the ID of the chosen candidate. Without making any
assumptions about who is running or even how many candidates there are, design
an $O(n\lg n)$-time algorithm to see who wins the election $S$ represents,
assuming the candidate with the most votes wins.\\[12pt]
