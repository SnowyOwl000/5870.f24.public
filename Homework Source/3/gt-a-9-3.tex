\item\problemnumber{GT A}{9}{3}{-}{.}
Suppose you are the postmaster in charge of putting a new post office in a small
town, where all the houses are along one street, where the new post office
should go as well. Let us view this street as a line and the houses on it as a
set of real numbers, $\lbrace x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\rbrace$, corresponding to
points on this line. To make everyone in town as happy as possible, the
location, $p$, for the new post office should minimize the sum
$$\sum_{i=1}^n|p-x_i|$$
Describe an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal location for the new
post office, show that your algorithm is correct, and analyze its running time.
