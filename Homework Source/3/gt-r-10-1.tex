Let $S=\lbrace a,b,c,d,e,f,g\rbrace$ be a collection of objects with
benefit-weight values $a:(12,4), b:(10,6), c:(8,5), d:(11,7), e:(14,3), f:(7,1),
g:(9,6)$. What is an optimal solution to the fractional knapsack problem for $S$
assuming we have a sack that can hold objects with total weight $18$? Show your
work.\\[12pt]
