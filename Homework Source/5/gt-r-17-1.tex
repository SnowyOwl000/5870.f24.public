Professor Amongus has shown that a decision problem $L$ is polynomial-time
reducible to an {\bf NP}-complete problem . Moreover, after $80$ pages of dense
mathematics, he has also just proven that $L$ can be solved in polynomial time.
Has he just proven that {\bf P} = {\bf NP}? Why, or why not?\\[12pt]
