Define {\tt INDEPENDENT-SET} as the problem that takes a graph $G$ and an
integer $k$ and asks whether $G$ contains an independent set of vertices of
size $k$. That is, $G$ contains a set $I$ of vertices of size $k$ such that, for
any $v$ and $w$ in $I$, there is no edge $(v,w)$ in $G$. Show that
{\tt INDEPENDENT-SET} is \emph{\bf NP}-complete.\\[12pt]
