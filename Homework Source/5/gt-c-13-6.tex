\item\problemnumber{GT C}{13}{6}{-}{.}
Let $G$ be an undirected graph whose vertices are the integers $1$ through $8$,
and let the adjacent vertices of each vertex be given by the table below:\\[6pt]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
    {\bf vertex} & {\bf adjacent vertices} \\ \hline\hline
    $1$ & $(2, 3, 4)$ \\ \hline
    $2$ & $(1, 3, 4)$ \\ \hline
    $3$ & $(1, 2, 4)$ \\ \hline
    $4$ & $(1, 2, 3, 6)$ \\ \hline
    $5$ & $(6, 7, 8)$ \\ \hline
    $6$ & $(4, 5, 7)$ \\ \hline
    $7$ & $(5, 6, 8)$ \\ \hline
    $8$ & $(5, 7)$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Assume that, in a traversal of $G$, the adjacent vertices of a given vertex are
returned in the same order as they are listed in the above table.\parend

\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii}}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
    \item Draw $G$.
    \item Order the vertices as they are visited in a DFS traversal starting at
        vertex $1$.
    \item Order the vertices as they are visited in a BFS traversal starting at
        vertex $1$.
