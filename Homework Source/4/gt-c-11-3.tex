There is a sorting algorithm, ``Stooge-sort,'' which is named after the comedy
team, ``The Three Stooges.'' If the input size, $n$, is $1$ or $2$, then the
algorithm sorts the input immediately. Otherwise, it recursively sorts the first
$2n/3$ elements, then the last $2n/3$ elements, and then the first $2n/3$
elements again. The details are shown in the following algorithm. Show that
Stooge-sort is correct and characterize the running time, $T(n)$, for
Stooge-sort, using a recurrence equation, and use the master theorem to
determine an asymptotic bound for $T(n)$.\\[12pt]
