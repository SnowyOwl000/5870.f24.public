Define the edit distance between two strings $X$ and $Y$ of length $n$ and $m$,
respectively, to be the number of edits that it takes to change $X$ into $Y$. An
edit consists of a character insertion, a character deletion, or a character
replacement. For example, the strings ``algorithm'' and ``rhythm'' have edit
distance $6$. Design an $\Theta(mn)$-time algorithm for computing the edit
distance between $X$ and $Y$.\\[12pt]
