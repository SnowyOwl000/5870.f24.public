\item\problemnumber{GT A}{12}{1}{-}{.}
Suppose that the coins of the fictional country of Combinatoria come in the
denominations $d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_k$, where $d_1=1$ and the other $d_i$ values form
a set of distinct integers greater than $1$. Given an integer, $n>0$, the
problem of making change is to find the fewest number of Combinatorian coins
whose values sum to $n$.
\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii}}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
\item Give an instance of the making-change problem for which it is suboptimal
    to use the standard greedy algorithm, which repeatedly chooses a
    highest-valued coin whose value is at most $n$ until the sum of chosen coins
    equals $n$.
\item Describe an efficient algorithm for solving the problem of making change.
    What is the running time of your algorithm?
