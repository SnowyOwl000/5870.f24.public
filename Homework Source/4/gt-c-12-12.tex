Let $P$ be a convex polygon (Section 22.1). A \emph{triangulation} of $P$ is an
addition of diagonals connecting the vertices of $P$ so that each interior face
is a triangle. The weight of a triangulation is the sum of the lengths of the
diagonals. Assuming that we can compute lengths and add and compare them in
constant time, give an efficient algorithm for computing a minimum-weight
triangulation of $P$.\\[12pt]
