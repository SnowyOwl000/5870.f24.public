\item\problemnumber{GT A}{1}{12}{-}{.}
Given an array $A$ of $n-2$ unique integers in the range from $1$ to $n$,
describe an $O(n)$-time algorithm for finding the two integers in the range from
$1$ to $n$ that are not in $A$. You may use only $O(1)$ space in addition to the
space used by $A$.\\[12pt]
