\emph{One-dimensional farthest pair}\/. Write an algorithm that, given an array
of $N$ numbers, finds a \emph{farthest pair}\/: two values whose difference is
no smaller than the difference of any other pair (in absolute value). The
running time of your algorithm must be linear in the worst case. Bonus points if
you can do exactly $\lfloor\frac{3N}{2}-\frac{3}{2}\rfloor$ comparisons.\\[12pt]
