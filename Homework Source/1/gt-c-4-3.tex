\item\problemnumber{GT C}{4}{3}{-}{.}
Show by induction that the minimum number, $n_h$ of internal nodes in an AVL
tree of height $h$, as defined in the proof of Theorem~4.1, satisfies the
following identity, for $h\ge1$:
$$n_h=F_{h+2}-1$$
where $F_k$ denotes the Fibonacci number of order $k$ defined in the previous
exercise.\\[12pt]
