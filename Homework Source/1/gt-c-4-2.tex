The \emph{Fibonacci sequence} is the sequence of numbers
$$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,\ldots$$
defined by the base cases $F_0=0$ and $F_1=1$ and the general-case recursive
definition $F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$ for $k\ge2$. Show by induction that, for $k\ge
3$, $$F_k\ge\phi^{k-2}$$ where $\phi=(1+\sqrt5)/2\approx1.618$, which is the
well-known \emph{golden ratio} that traces its history to the ancient Greeks.

\emph{Hint}\/: Note that $\phi^2=\phi+1$; hence, $\phi^k=\phi^{k-1}+\phi^{k-2}$
for $k\ge3$.\\[12pt]
