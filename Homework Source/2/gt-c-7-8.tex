Suppose we implement the tree-based union-find data structure, but we don't use
the union-by-size heuristic nor the path-compression heuristic. Show that the
total running time for performing a sequence of $n$ union and find operations,
starting with $n$ singleton sets, is $\Theta(n^2)$ in this case. That is,
provide a proof that it is $O(n^2)$ and an example that requires $\Theta(n^2)$
time.\\[12pt]
