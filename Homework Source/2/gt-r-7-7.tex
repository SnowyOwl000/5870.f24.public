Suppose we have $20$ singleton sets, numbered $0$ through $19$, and we call the
operation ${\sc union}({\sc find}(i),{\sc find}(i+5))$, for $i=0,1,2,\ldots,14$.
Draw a picture of a tree-based representation of the sets that result, assuming
we don't implement the union-by-size and path compression heuristics.\\[12pt]
