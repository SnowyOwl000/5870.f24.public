\item\problemnumber{GT A}{7}{5}{-}{.}
Consider the game of Hex, as in the previous exercise, but now with a twist.
Suppose some number, $k$, of the cells in the game board are colored gold and if
the set of stones that connect the two sides of a winning player's board are
also connected to $k'\le k$ of the gold cells, then that player gets $k'$ bonus
points. Describe an efficient way to detect when a player wins and also, at that
same moment, determine how many bonus points they get. What is the running time
of your method over the course of a game consisting of $n$ moves?\\[12pt]
